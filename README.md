# About the project
This is the project I was working on when I was 17 
  
Highly ambitious to say the least 
  
Didn't last long before I moved on to something else ahah
  
# Requirements  
  
written in C++  
must be cross platform (any hardware, any OS)  
very easy to use  
modular, easy to extend  
multi gpu support if possible  
must also support having a lot of graphs (if someone wants a large simulations with a lot of entities controlled by neural networks for example)  
we're going to use computational graphs  
(unless you can find a better alternative)  
for the number crunching we're going to use SYCL or OpenCL (again, unless you find a better alternative)  
I think SYCL would be better, it's easier, full C++ and can execute any C++ lambda on any hardware in parallel
